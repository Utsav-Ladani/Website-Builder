# Easy-web-builder
## Introduction
This project helps developer to create website faster. This project is a WYSIWYG type.
I feel that many web developer start their web from scratch and it's good but it take more time.Some company give services but it may be paid.This idea came in my mind so i start this open source project.So developers make some basic template using this and became creative and fast.I belive that open source platform have more ability to create some great.

## How to run project
This is a very simple project so you not need to worry about libraries or frameworks.I use only HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript basics.
For run this project you can't run on browser direct.But you need a localhost.I suggest you vscode editor. It is good for begginers and it has cool extensions to run your code easly.
step:
1) Download [vs code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).
2) Press ``ctrl+shift+X`` or open extension panel and search ``"live server"``.Download it.
3) Open vs code and go to File>open folder and then select folder(this folder is which you download from github)
4) Go to ``public>html`` and open ``index.html`` file and right click, select ``"open with live server"``.
5) Go to web browser(which one you like) and type ``"localhost:3000"`` in search bar and enter.
6) Make your own site which you like :)
